                    <article>
                        <h1><centre>INTRODUCTION</centre></h1>
                        <p>Nowadays, students mostly rely on the internet for their education than their books.</p><br>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="./images/Modern-Education.png" alt="Efficient Administration">
                        </div>
                        <p>As times have changed, technology has evolved, and I am not saying that this is bad, but just over usage of anything results in a bad situation. Students less than 12 years old are nowadays having their own mobile phones which is just too young to provide them. Because if we just have a glance at the records, it has been found that from 1990's to 2000, 95% out of the total adult kids got their personal phones when they were around 25 to 30 years of age. And that too not the modern smartphones, but the cell phones. Records show that more than 90% of kids at that time didn't had their own phone till the age of 28 or above.</p><br>
                        <p>To add some more, the era between the 2000's and 2010 had a major growth in the number of mobile phone users. Kids
                        started getting their personal phones at the age of less than 20. As technology grew, in 2019, there were kids who got
                        their own mobiles under the age of 15 itself!</p><br>
                        <p>And then invaded the virus, which drastically and eventually grew the number EXPONENTIALLY! Because, people relied more
                        on their phones, which I am not saying is wrong, but kids got an advantage as their personal phones started to roll in
                        even when they were not teens!</p><br><br>
                        <p>Kids have become more stubborn nowadays. And today, in 2021, more than 65% of kids get their own phones before the age
                        of 13 itself! Well, parents are forced nowadays and they can do nothing because today's world is always online. Online
                        classes were the only option left for children to gain education. And the overuse of mobile phones led to hacks in the
                        mobiles which children weren't aware of. Also, another disadvantage of this was that children had to use spectacles in a
                        very low age of 7 - 10 etc! This revolution made a huge loss to the world and children, neither grew much smarter. Many
                        reports state that more 55% of kids use their phone not for classes, but for other social platforms such as youtube,
                        instagram, Facebook etc.
                        </p><br>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="./images/dgf.png" alt="Efficient Administration">
                        </div>
                        <p>Now, for kids who are reading this, don't blame anyone. And also, do not get annoyed because it is not really your
                        fault, it is the technology that has made the revolution and you were the kid who is living in this technological era.
                        The only thing I want to state is, be natural, man! I am not telling you not to use your personal phones (to those who
                        have their phones) but also give some time to your family as well. Kids think when they grow up, they become self
                        sufficient of everything. Which is in fact not true. Please don't blame your parents as they were the ones who had given
                        birth to you. They were the ones who showed you the world. Whichever advice they give you is always in your benefit and
                        not your loss. So, this was just the beginning of the introduction.</p>
                        <p>And to end the introduction, I would like to say that it is not the fault of kids, not the fault of the parents. It is
                        just that you are being controlled by today's technology and that's it. Don't let anyone control you. Control yourselves
                        from your habits. Always remember, only you can control and improve yourselves from anyone.</p>
                        <p>Phew! That's a lot! But if you see it clearly, we get to know how this works has developed so fast.</p>
                        <P>So, now as you must be wondering, the title says something and we are reading something. So, this was the introduction
                        as to how to change yourselves. I know, you now know that only you can change yourselves, but I guess I can help you a
                        little and even my self from these tips that will surely help you to change your non-educational habits. So, welcome to
                        Enlightened Wisdom: Smart SCIENCE!</P>
                        <p>Let's get started!</p><br>

                        <h1>FIVE TIPS TO FOCUS ON YOUR STUDY.</h1>
                        <p>1) Keep Your phones and tablets away from your study room: As we have already discussed before, it is not a good idea to
                        study while chatting with your friends in between. Now, that's another case when you have to study online as it is a
                        must to do, but whenever you are free, try to read books. And if you want to use your device then use for a good
                        purpose. You should chat only when you are chatting. You should study only when your are studying. And if you want to
                        study on your device. Then visit knowledgeable and safe websites to gain more knowledge and be enlightened.</p>
                        <p>So, back to topic, we know distraction is the worst enemy when you are studying. Distraction can be anything. Like your
                        phone, your food, a noise etc. So, always make sure to study when you are in these particular conditions where there is
                        no distraction.</p>
                        <p>a) No loud noise.</p>
                        <p>b) No phones or any other device in your room.</p>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="./images/whogetsmostd.jpg" alt="Efficient Administration">
                        </div>
                        <p>c) Don't eat whenever you are studying. This can cause a major distraction because while eating, your brain relishes the
                        meal and almost forgets what you were doing. Now, this is not the case everytime. You may eat, but whenever you are
                        going for an exam or something, make sure to follow this tip.</p>
                        <p>*Also, if you want your device to be with you, then just turn off the notifications and study calmly.</p><br>
                        <p>2) Study in a peaceful environment: It is often seen that students need peace to study which is very difficult for them
                        to manage in areas which are prone to high pitched sound. But you can use your ear cups if this is the case! And for
                        those who have a peaceful nature, they should close their room, worship your gods and they study peacefully. Make sure
                        there should be least disturbance in your study and focus. Eat almonds and drink a lot of milk to study even better. And
                        remember, study not just for your exams but study for your whole life!</p><br>
                        <p>3) Study in good light: Now this point just states that you should always study in a good light. That is, the light that
                        you are studying in should neither be too dim, nor be too bright. Nowadays, kids are always busy on their phones and see
                        them all day till night when they don't even know how harmful is the effect of blue light on their eyes. Blue light
                        actually harms your eyes when you are seeing your device. But, there is an advanced option to save your eyes from the
                        harmful blue rays. You may just turn on the night light button and then study! Useful.</p>
                        <p>Kids have eye issues mainly due to this. So you should must follow this tip.</p><br>
                        <p>4) Set your time and learn according to it: Set a good timetable and work according to it. It is the best way to
                        organize yourself.</p><br>
                        <p>5) Avoid Distractions And Don't Study When you are hungry: Study in a peaceful environment and study with full
                        concentration. Also, when you are hungry, then do not study. Study only when you are satisfied and fulfilled. Be
                        Nourished!</p><br>
                        <p>I hope you'll follow these tips and focus on your education and avoid distraction.</p>
                        <p>Thank you!</p>
