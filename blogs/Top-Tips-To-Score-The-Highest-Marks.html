                    <article><h1>Always feel positive</h1>
                        <p>Positive attitude is the key to solve many of the problems which you face in your life. During
                        exam time, this is an important feature to have in you for success and crack your exams with flying colors. Attitude is
                        important for all students because it reflects your personality as well as your confidence or self-confidence. It always
                        takes you on top of everything, whether it is for exams or interviews or your life itself. Positive attitude will take
                        you on through the door of success and make you feel full of self-confidence. So, never think anything negative in your
                        mind and be fulfilled with thoughts of positivity!</p>

                        </div>

                        <h1>Plan well for studying</h1>
                        <p>Never try to read anything or to study or cram just before the exam time, even if your friend asks you to prepare for
                        some topic he has missed or left during preparation for the exams. Close your book an hour before the exam starts and
                        stay relaxed, unworried and full of self-confidence. Also get up early in the morning and take another review of the
                        important topics and make yourself filled with confidence, as confidence is the main property to score well. The night
                        before the exam you should go to bed early to make your brain as well as body relax a bit and to be well prepared for
                        the exams, as our brain too needs a rest to be fresh and fine for the exam.</p>
                        <h1>During exam time</h1>
                        <p>Check out all the things you require during exam time like pen, pencil, sketch pens, rubber, ruler, sharpener etc. Each
                        and everything, whether it is small or big matters a lot during your exam time. Read all the instructions carefully
                        before starting the paper and keep them in your mind during exam time or else revisit the instructions if you have any
                        confusion. Why? So that you don't make any foolish mistake regarding instructions during examination time. So it is
                        important.</p>
                        <h1>Attempting the question paper</h1>
                        <p>Read out all the questions carefully before writing anything on the answer sheet and always start with answering those
                        questions which will carry maximum marks as well as you think are tougher or need more time to think. When you start
                        from small questions, you will always feel the problem of answering the remaining lengthy questions. So, that's why time
                        management is very important during exams. You can answer small questions even in the last 30 minutes but you will never
                        be able to write enough for the lengthy questions in the end which will eventually result in less or poor marks. Manage
                        correctly according to the questions and think like a scholar. And as always stay positive.</p>
                        <h1>When you feel stuck at a question during exam</h1>
                        <p>There will be a moment in your exam where you will feel stuck with some questions or a single question. You just need to
                        be relaxed and calm, and no need to panic or be in tension. Make yourself confident and try to think or remember the
                        answer with a cool mind. If you don't feel to give the answer at that time, make any sign or circle the question number
                        and move on. Then try to finish it after you complete all the questions. I follow this tip a lot. Also, never ever try
                        to think about that "stuck" question while writing the answers for other questions. This will only reduce your
                        concentration and when you find no way out, just make a guess and attempt that question as there is no other probable
                        way. And this may give you a chance of scoring better than before.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Answer sheet should be neat and clean</h1>
                        <p>And the last tip for you is that Handwriting matters a lot for good and highest marks during your exam, as your writing
                        makes the first impression on the examiner's mind and the examiner sometimes awards some extra marks for good
                        handwriting. Nevertheless, handwriting affects the nature of reading. Underline the important lines to attract the
                        examiner's attention so that he/she can make a right mindset about the answer given and also reward you with the full or
                        maximum marks (Note: It is not always that you will get marks for your handwriting but still your writing should be good
                        so that the examiner can read it properly).
